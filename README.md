# FakeStore API Final Project

This is my final submission for Coding Temple's Software Engineering boot camp. It is a React-Bootstrap based jsx project using react-router, hooks, and connected to the FakeStore API to populate fake product 
listings. It shows my ability to not only write standard JS, but also shows my ability to use React to build responsive web apps. I will continue to work on my skills in this area, as this is my first
full React based project.
